In this paper, a group of scientists observe historical notes from
four centuries to reinforce our model of human based-global
warming. They investigate the data of Japanese months, who every year
marked when a certain lake froze, and if it froze at all, since 1600.

Their main work was to understand and analize the data, and decide 
whether and how much of it was reliable, what was the associated error 
with the data, and what sort of conclusions could be drawn from it.
