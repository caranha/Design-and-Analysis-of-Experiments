### How to do Good Research, get it published in SIGKDD and get it cited!
Eamonn Keogh, University of California - Riverside  
- [Presentation](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Keogh_SIGKDD09_tutorial.pdf)

173 Presentation slides of good advice on how to define your research topic,
scope, writing, practices. Warnings against common mistakes that young 
(and not so young) scientists often make.

### Reproducibility of research
- http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html
  In 2012, a medical company tried to reproduce 53 landmark papers
  in Cancer research. Only 11% of the results were reproducible.

  In 2015, 100 papers in psychological science were reproduced,
  only 33% of the replications showed the same degree of 
  significance as the original papers

### "Historical Trends in Lake and River Ice Cover in the Northern Hemisphere"
- [National Geographic Summary](http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/26/lake-suwas-shinto-legend-and-the-oldest-lake-ice-record-on-earth-what-it-tells-us-about-climate-change-and-variability/)
- [Full paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/289/5485/1743.full)

In this paper, a group of scientists observe historical notes from
four centuries to reinforce our model of human based-global
warming. They investigate the data of Japanese months, who every year
marked when a certain lake froze, and if it froze at all, since 1600.

Their main work was to understand and analize the data, and decide 
whether and how much of it was reliable, what was the associated error 
with the data, and what sort of conclusions could be drawn from it.
