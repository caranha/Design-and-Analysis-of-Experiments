Notes for myself to change and improve the repository

# Class Preparation Framework
1. The directory TSUKUBA/LectureXX will contain notes and extra materials 
for each of the 10 week lectures.
2. If necessary, a XX-Tsukuba.{tex,pdf} file will be created for use in class. 
If not, the notes will be mentioned orally (and available in the repository).
3. Send Pull Requests/Issues to Campelo
