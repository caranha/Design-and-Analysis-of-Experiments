Hello! 

This fork of Felipe Campelo's "Design and Analysis of Experiments" is 
used as the lecture notes for the course "01ch740 -- Experiment Design"
at Tsukuba University, with permission from the original author.

If you are a student of this course, please take note of the following:

# Main reference materials

Use the directories "XX-Chaptername" and "Reference Materials" as the main reference
materials for this course. We will try to go over all of it in our 10 weeks, so 
read it accordingly.

(Copies of the relevant parts of this material will be included in the MANABA system
as appropriate)

# In-class materials

The materials which we will use on a class-by-class basis (schedule, extra references,
lecture notes) are in the TSUKUBA directory. Make sure to check this directory for 
material specific to our version of the course.

# Unrelated material

The materials in the other directories (Forms, Grading, Semester Files) are specific for the 
original UFMG version of this course, therefore, probably not of interest to the 
students of 01ch740, but feel free to browse anyway!




Have fun, 
Claus Aranha
