## Substitution Class

In the case that any of the classes are cancelled for some unknown reason 
(teacher being sick, Godzilla attacking Tsukuba), 06/23 will be used as a 
replacement class. Otherwise, 06/23 will be used as a final review class 
where the students can ask questions about the course contents and get
help with their final presentations/reports
