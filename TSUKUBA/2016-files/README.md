## Lecture Notes for Experiment Design in Computer Sciences (01CH740)
### Tsukuba Fork -- Claus Aranha

Here are the materials used for the lecture "Experiment Design in Computer Sciences", offered 
every spring semester in the Computer Science English Program at the University of Tsukuba.

This is a derivative work from the "Lecture Notes on Design & Analysis of Experiments", by Professor
Felipe Campelo of UFMG. See below for more details.

This repository may be of use for students who wish to prepare in Advance, but be aware that some 
of the materials here may still suffer some modifications before being used in class. Make sure 
to always check the [[MANABA page for the course](https://manaba.tsukuba.ac.jp/ct/course_578828)] for
the latest version of any material.

See the TSUKUBA directory for important information regarding the differences of the DoE course in 
UFMG and the EDCS course in Tsukuba.
