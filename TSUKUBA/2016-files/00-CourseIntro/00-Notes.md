Notes from Claus about Chapter 00

# Thoughts
## John W. Tukey
- Introduced the FFT
- Statician, worked with the analysis of artillery fire
- Introduced a wide array of Statistical Analysis tools
  - TukeyHSD (Honest Significant Differences) for post-hoc analysis of ANOVA

## Course Overview 
- I really hate written exams, but I might consider adding them for a future year.

## Bibliography
- These lecture notes are a derivative work from Felipe Campelo's original notes,
  so I feel a bit uncomfortable citing him as bibliography, but same goes for me.
  For now, this point goes without one fixed author.

## Required/Desired Background
- Enrollment deadline for both the R Programming course and the Reproducible Research
  course is April 17th.
