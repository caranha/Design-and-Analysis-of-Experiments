==========================================

Tokay:
# Study together
Two numerical examples to work with the class
- Analysis of the data (point estimator, distribution, intervals)
- Description of the scientific questions and null hypothesis
- Analysis of the statistical inference
- Presentation of the results

First the students should try to do it by themselves, 
Then I show my version of the work.

## Example 1: Coin study case from Campelo
## Example 2: Analysis of algorithmic performance (My data)


# Report 3
- List of questions and data to be answered
- Let the students work on class, but do not intervene unless asked.
- Deadline: 1 week

For each case study:
- Describe the data using point estimators and confidence intervals.
- Identify the relevant question, hypothesis and statistical test
- Perform the test and report the result

## Case Study 1
- Sewage Disposal in River biodiversity (CS3-2015)

## Case Study 2
- Soltimes.csv -- Detect the difference between algorithm A and B
