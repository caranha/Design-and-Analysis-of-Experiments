=========================================

# Class outline

## Material: Tsukuba, W1
- Self introduction
- Course motivation and details
- Materials and student Requirements

## Open for questions

## The Magic Door game

## Discussion: What is science?

## Material: Campelo, Ch1
- What is science?

## Scientists listed
- Pasteur Quote: In the field of observation, chance favors the prepared mind
- Kekule:
-- Theory of Chemical Structure
-- Structure of Benzene ("Dream of Ourobouros"), intuition confirmed by experiments
- Henri Becquerel:
-- Discoverer of Radioactivity
-- Originally was studying the effect of "phosphorescence", i.e., an object that 
   receives one color of light, will emit another color back.
-- He tried to do such experiment with uranium salts, by letting them absorb sunlight,
   and then measure the X-rays that came out.
-- But one of his observations is that the X-rays still came out even if the input of 
   sunlight did not happen.
- Alexander Fleming:
-- Pelicilin -- Discovery by accident
-- He was studying a bacteria. When he went on a trip, he left many cultures of that bacteria 
   in a corner of his lab. One of the cultures got mold, and the entire culture died completely.
   By further studying that mould, he found out that it would kill many bacteria known to 
   cause diseases, and went on to study how to transform this mold into a medicine.
-- "That's funny"

## Warning about cargo cult science
