# Pre-chapter discussion Topic
- Question about progress of R study;
- Talk about RadioLab and the Henrietta Lacks Episode
  - Henrietta Lacks was a woman who died young of cancer. In 1951.
  - A biopsy of her cancer, unlike many human cells, did not die quickly out of the body, but thrived. 
  - This was extremely important, because until them there were no long-living human cell cultures. And with live human cell cultures, we could do many experiments that were not possible to do with humans. For example, develop polio vaccine by infecting those cells with the polio virus.
  - More importantly, the cientist who first studied HeLa cells shared them with the entire world for free. Instead of patenting it and keeping it a tightly controlled secret, he shared it far and wide. Open science!

## Fun Facts
- John Kruscke:

  - Bayesian logic: Trying to reason based on observations. 
    Given the facts that I observed, what is the probability that the world is like I see it is. 
    Using the probability of known events to predict future events.
    Bayes theorem (P(A|B) = P(A+B)/P(B)
    Think of how the existing evidence support your hypothesis.

- Educated Guessing Winery
  - It really exists! (California)

- Thomas Huxley: "Darwin's bulldog"
  - lived in the same time as darwins. He used to do heavy criticism of contemporary ideas of the development of man. It is said that darwin invited him to comment on his ideas before he first published them, and Huxleys response was "How extremely stupid that no one thought of that yet!".

- Homeopaty: Once published in Nature, and then retracted when investigated.
  - Wanted to prove homeopaty "independently". In the initial paper, there were no "obvious" methodological faults.
  - But there was a following investigation on it. "Alternative medicine, when proved using science, becomes good old medicine"

  
## Definitions of "experiments"
- Three "classes for experiments":
    - Ask for the students to give suggestions of experiments 
      in each of the three classes.
    - Each of these strategies have different degrees of freedom, 
      but all of them involves **choice** from the part of the 
      experimenter. 
    - We must be CONSCIOUS of this choice first, and then decide 
      how we will make these choices
    - **TODO**: Add the slide about choice between these slides and the 
      next one. Propose as a pull request to Campelo

- Important Concepts in experiment design:
    - Factors: Controllable and Non-controllable
    - Variables: Dependent and Independent
    - Outcomes: Relationship with Hypothesis
    - Control

## Required Reading Analysis:
- (1) Very good suggestions, from writing to analysis. Takes 10 minutes to read.
- (2) Second Link 404s, google the title (single page document)
- (3) Third title can be found googling the title -- how to manipulate statistics to fit preconcieved ideas
