# Class Notes
## Goal for this class
- The statistics that we described in class 3 are "descriptive" 
  statistics. In other words, we observe facts about the world, and 
  use these facts to describe a system.

- But if we have a machine that produces cables with mean resistance 
  between 48.3 and 51.2 Ohms, in a 95% confidence interval, what does this mean?
  Is the machine broken? Is it functional? Is it better than the previous machine?

- The idea of this class is to use the descriptive statistics that we 
  mentioned in the previous class, and use the to make INFERENCES about the world.
