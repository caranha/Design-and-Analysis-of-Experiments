## Discussion about last week

- Summary of Last week class (science as a process/society/structure):
- Discuss the progress of R study:
  Remind them that they will need these tools in class. Comments that the Reproducible Science course,
  specially, is very important not only for their research, but even reports (talk more about this course)
- Ask if anyone read "Statistics done Wrong".
  Remind them that this is a very important motivation about why this course is necessary. Remind them 
  to read it again.
- PhD comic "Yo"
- Other questions in general

"AI is a cool problem"

## Other comments from the survey
- Importance of Inspiration
  (science popularization: Radiolab, Neil De Grasse Tyson, SciShow, magazines, etc)
  
- Why are there no asians among the favorite scientists?

# Notes for 02-Chapter.pdf
- John Kruscke: 
  - http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.jp
  - Bayesian logic: Trying to reason based on observations. 
    Given the facts that I observed, what is the probability that the world is like I see it is. 
    Using the probability of known events to predict future events.
    Bayes theorem (P(A|B) = P(A+B)/P(B)
    Think of how the existing evidence support your hypothesis.
    
- Picking up where we left:
    Last class we discussed the different components of science. In this class(and most of the course), 
    we will focus on one of these components: obtaining data through experimentation, and evaluating this data.

- Three "classes" of experiments
    Ask the students to try to imagine each of these classes, give my own ideas.
    Each of these strategies have different degrees of freedom, but all of them involve **choice**
    from the part of the experimenter. We must be CONSCIOUS of this choice first, and then
    decide how we will make these choices
    TODO: Add the slide about choice between these slides and the next one. Propose as 
    a pull request to Campelo

- Educated Guessing:
    Introduce some of the vocabulary which we will use to talk about experiments.
    An experiment has **factors** that may (or may not) influence its results, and usually may
    (but sometimes may not) be controlled. These factors can usually be thought as the 
    "inputs" of the experiments. 
    A factor has levels, which are possible values for the factors (can be discrete, can be 
    continuous)    

- Educated Guessing Winery:
    A real winery in California

- Experimentation Strategies:
    Highlight each strategies strong and weak points using real life example
    (Probably examples from my own research for now - For example, earthquake or history macthing)
    TODO: Tsukuba support slides: data/tables/images from my expe  riments.

- Design of experiment:
    To summarize, we can see that there are many choices that have to be made when 
    we perform data gathering (an experiment). Is the data gathering from historical sources?
    Observations? Controlled situations? How do we regulate for the factors?
    
- Slide 14: Add more concrete examples of these points. 
    (spend at least 10-15 minutes on this slide, because next slide is a completely different topic)
    
- Slide 15: We will now talk about why this is important: to Avoid phony research.     
    Person who popularized the use of "agnosticism" as a description of a worldview: I dont believe 
    anything that cannot be backed up by facts.
    
   Thomas Huxley: "Darwin's bulldog"
    - lived in the same time as darwins. He used to do heavy criticism of contemporary ideas of 
    the development of man. It is said that darwin invited him to comment on his ideas before he 
    first published them, and Huxleys response was "How extremely stupid that no one thought of that yet!".

- Homeopaty: Once published in Nature, and then retracted when investigated.
  - Wanted to prove homeopaty "independently". In the initial paper, there were no "obvious" methodological faults.
  - But there was a following investigation on it.
  "Alternative medicine, when proved using science, becomes good old medicine"
  
## Required Reading Analysis:
- (1) Very good suggestions, from writing to analysis. Takes 10 minutes to read.
- (2) Second Link 404s, google the title (single page document)
- (3) Third title can be found googling the title -- how to manipulate statistics to fit preconcieved ideas

  
    
# Post-class notes
## Group Project
- Now that you saw this class, we can discuss the group project (and the personal report)
- TODO: Write a tsukuba version of the Final Project and the Rmarkdown template
- TODO: Description of the Group project is straight from Felipes document
- TODO: Description of the personal report should be written on the same format
- TODO: Put the modified documents in the Tsukuba Folder

## One more short read for you
- This week short read: 
  tinkerer vs researcher -- http://togelius.blogspot.jp/2016/04/the-differences-between-tinkering-and.html?m=1
  :"Many people described their research as _creating an application_. Sometimes I worry about students
  focusing so much on the creating part, that they don't do the due diligence on the research part."
