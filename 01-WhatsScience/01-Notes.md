# Comments for Chapter 01

## Contents Comments 
- (2) Carl Sagan is an awesome man, very appropriate to the chapter of
"what is science". Talk a bit about him.
- (3) What is science? -- Ask the class what is science before coming to this slide.
- (5) A very common (and a bit useful) definition of science, but an oversimplification
- (6) Recommend to read the "understanding science" page (actually already listed in the end)

- (7) Story of the figures mentioned:
  - Pasteur Quote: In the field of observation, chance favors the prepared mind
  - Kekule:
    - Theory of Chemical Structure
    - Structure of Benzene ("Dream of Ourobouros"), intuition confirmed by experiments
  - Henri Becquerel:
    - Discoverer of Radioactivity
    - Originally was studying the effect of "phosphorescence", i.e., an object that 
      receives one color of light, will emit another color back.
    - He tried to do such experiment with uranium salts, by letting them absorb sunlight,
      and then measure the X-rays that came out.
    - But one of his observations is that the X-rays still came out even if the input of 
      sunlight did not happen.
  - Alexander Fleming:
    - Pelicilin -- Discovery by accident
    - He was studying a bacteria. When he went on a trip, he left many cultures of that bacteria 
      in a corner of his lab. One of the cultures got mold, and the entire culture died completely.
      By further studying that mould, he found out that it would kill many bacteria known to 
      cause diseases, and went on to study how to transform this mold into a medicine.
    - "That's funny"

- (8) Now that you have the idea, you need to do the hard work of gathering/intreperting this 
  data. By the way, this is what most of this course will be about, and this is usually what
  people think as "science". But science does not limit to this in any way.
- (9) Anyway, up to James Lind example. Did you know that British Sailors were called limes 
  because of this? 
- (9) This would be a good time to mention the story of John Snow (not that one).

## After the chapter
- Open for questions from students. Ask about how they saw science before, if there 
  are any changes, questions or disagreements.
- This would be a good time to play the "Natural Rule" game.
- Maaaybe end class 1 here, depending on time.

## Future Changes
- Add a "summary" to the end of the chapter
- Students loved the "science game", add the science game to the chapter
- Add some information about getting scientific news and science communications. (Maybe to Chapter 02)
